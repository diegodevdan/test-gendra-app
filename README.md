# TEST GENDRA APP

First i want to say thank u for give the opportunity 
of make the test. 

Second i want tell something about the code.
I follow some rules of programation and i'm in
continous learning.

I love the ui/ux and the frontend, i like to
the backend with java, but i feel more stronger
in frontend.

===============================================

I divide my projects in this
    -Design
    -Implement Design
    -Code
    -Test (TDD)
    -Accomplished

I have the necessity to make the wireframes
and the design, but this take a time and
for this test and prefer only focus on the
code.

Every feedback for little that is, is really
helpful for the progress of both sides
me and you.

Hope u like this test and see my code, i think
is clean and easy to read.

I don't make comment lines in my code but for
this test i made a little comments for mostly
pages.
